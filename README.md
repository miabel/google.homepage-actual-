# Description
This is a mini project in which I attempted to recreate the google homepage. Though I faced many obstacles and often wanted to quit, this project is proof of my hard work.
# What I Learned
  - manipulating the aesthetics of a page using CSS
  - manipulating border-radius
  - using float to move objects left, right, or up
  - switching between ids and classes when necessary
  - how to put the skills I learned into practice
